          <em>"the Milwaukee metropolitan area has been transformed into a game of Grand Theft Auto wherein the Kia Boyz
            are
            preying on the owners to steal their cars in droves."
            <br>

          In the early 2020s an enormous wave of thefts targeting Kia and Hyundai cars swept
          the United States. Many of the thieves, calling themselves ‘Kia Boyz’, have taken to
          posting content boasting of their exploits to Tiktok and other social media platforms. The press has called
          this phenomena the ‘Kia Challenge’.

        <h2>A bad idea.</h2>

        <p>

          Between 2015 and 2021 Kia-Hyundai chose to remove immobilisers in 14 popular cars in the United States.
          Designed to protect against hotwiring, immobilisers are simple circuits that prevent a car from starting
          without a key in the ignition. Immobilisers have been legally required in all new cars sold in Australia,
          Canada, and several European countries since the early 2000s, and are present in over 90% of cars sold in the
          United States. </p>

      <div id="salesChart"></div>

      <div class="diagram">
        <div class="text3b">
          <p> Given that the cars were designed to have immobilisers for international markets, this created a unique
            security vulnerability to a very simple attack - by physically removing the keyhole, it is possible to
            simply turn the key mechanism and start the car. Conveniently, the mechanism protrudes out in a size that
            approximates a standard USB cable. 
            
            <br><br>
            Kia’s decision has endangered potentially five million vehicles to theft.
            As the firm began to face the first round of lawsuits, they stated that they ‘believe these vehicles are
            fully compliant with federal anti-theft requirements’, but provided a free upgrade program combining
            physical parts and software updates to solve the security flaw. The rollout is as of yet incomplete, and
            Kia/Hyundai models continue to be targeted, often being damaged considerably in attempted thefts even if the
            updates prevent it. For this reason State Farm, one of the largest insurers in the United States, dropped
            coverage for all affected models produced between 2016-2021 in several states.

        <h2>The Kia Boyz</h2>
        <p>
          At some point in the late 2010s and early 2020s, thefts of Kia and Hyundai cars began to increase beyond their
          typical rate in ways that indicate patterns of targeted behaviour. The first city where this pattern emerged
          appears to be Milwaukee, a Wisconsin city of half a million located 90 minutes from Chicago, but clear growth
          in thefts of Kia/Hyundai models is visible across the entire country more or less simultaneously, in states as
          far away as Colorado and Texas.

            <br><br>
            Though the thefts spread very quickly, what’s truly surprising is the enthusiasm shown towards stealing cars
            by many of the criminals, who have taken to posting videos of their exploits on social media and calling
            themselves ‘Kia Boyz’. While many accounts have been banned, a search on tiktok reveals approximately 110
            Kia Boyz accounts are still active, spread out across [number] of cities in [number] of states. Most of
            these videos show groups of teenage boys driving Kias with a surprising disregard for their own freedom and
            safety and an even greater indifference to the car being stolen itself, with the destroyed steering column
            characteristic of the ‘hack’ often proudly on display alongside items found inside the vehicle. Despite the
            danger, the actual content is generally quite light hearted in tone, showing the ‘Boyz’ laughing as they
            joyride, though some of it is clearly intended to be more intimidating and depict the thieves as active gang
            members. The most immediate comparison that comes to mind is the imagery surrounding the ‘Drill’ Hip Hop
            subgenre that emerged from Chicago gang culture in the early 2010s - youthful, nihilistic, and often
            surprisingly specific about the details of actual crimes being committed, which are frequently alluded
            towards on social media.
            <br><br>
            Kia Boyz content long predates the mid-2022 viral spread of the ‘Kia Challenge’, with some videos found as
            early as 2020. Though some videos have a degree of popularity, particularly in the wake of the viral spread
            of the ‘Kia Challenge’ and a few accounts have followers in the hundreds of thousands, most of this content
            is largely anonymous, obscure, and interchangeable, and no ‘Kia Boyz’ account has had real lasting social
            media popularity. As with Drill rap, it feels as though the assumed audience is already familiar enough with
            the culture surrounding it that no real explanation is necessary, and widespread popularity is a distant
            concern if it is present at all.

          <p>In other words, it is likely that what’s really going on here is the broader public getting a narrow
            glimpse into the
            social media bubble of teen criminals, and not a crime wave that is being driven by social media itself. In
            Wisconsin,
            the FBI’s official statistics of car theft arrests from 2019-2022 shows a clear trend of growth being driven
            by a teen
            demographic. Looking at the distribution across time, however, seems to not show a significant change to the
            demographic distribution of car theft results. Though teenage boys grow to 50% over the 2019-2022 period,
            this trend
            does not appear to be significantly different to the normal fluctuations that are visible just a few years
            earlier in
            the same statistics. Also, given that in Wisconsin car theft is only a misdemeanour for offenders under the
            age of 18,
            it is likely that part of the increase is driven by the same individuals being arrested repeatedly.
            <br>
            <br>
            The two available online interviews with self-identified ‘Kia Boyz’, by Youtube accounts ‘TommyB’ and
            ‘Channel 5’ seem
            to indicate that many are close to the bottom of an existing organised crime hierarchy: in Channel 5’s ‘CT
            Kia Boyz’
            video the young men interviewed describe their scheme as stealing Kias and then selling on them for as
            little as $100 to
            presumably more serious criminals seeking getaway cars for robberies and shootings. The young men in the
            video are also
            shown purchasing and selling small quantities of marijuana, and attempt to sell DVDs found in one car for
            $20 each.

        <h2>A crime story.</h2>
        <p>
      
        The realities of the Kia theft wave become clearer when compared to other trends in crime in the wake of the COVID
        pandemic. In particular, the wave of thefts of catalytic converters since 2020 show a similar trend of being brought
        about by design flaws and encouraged by market conditions. Catalytic converters are simple car parts that filter
        pollutants from exhaust pipes, but they are generally made with precious metals so they can be resold quite easily to
        scrapyards. However, they were not specifically targeted by thieves until quite recently, so they tend to lack
        identifying marks and can be easily removed with power tools. Stealing catalytic converters was not an economically
        viable scheme, until the COVID pandemic significantly drove up the prices of these metals, and left several cars exposed
        during the long lockdown periods. This led to a similarly shocking wave of thefts, with several reports of organised
        gangs going through entire parking lots and systematically stealing dozens of converters. The catalytic converter theft
        wave has been curbed significantly in the United States by falling metal prices and new laws mandating serial numbers on
        converters and criminalising the ownership of converters without a car. Ultimately however, the people who would perform
        these kinds of thefts have probably moved on to other ventures.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Ultimately, the Kia theft wave is very similar, only with a slightly younger demographic, and social media is not a
        serious influence. It’s not that your son could be encouraged or hypnotised into stealing a Kia by a Tiktok - it's just
        stealing Kias suddenly became really easy, and the people who do that have Tiktok too.

      <div class="text8">
        <h2>The Kia Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          The ‘Kia Challenge’ was never a real social media trend, and this is reflected clearly in the google trend
          data that
          tracks the frequency of associated search terms. A true cultural phenomenon would show consistent interest,
          but with
          the term ‘Kia Challenge’ a few events connected to media coverage clearly dominate everything else in terms of
          traffic. Terms related to the mechanics behind the ‘hack’, which would presumably be of use to actual
          criminals, like
          ‘How to steal a Kia’ and ‘Kia USB’, show negligible interest.
          <br><br>
          Instead, interest in Kia thefts is concentrated around a media narrative with five key events, three of which
          are
          clearly visible as peaks in search interest:
          <br><br>
          In May 2022 Milwaukee content creator ‘Tommy G’ interviewed a group of self-identified Kia Boyz, in a
          15-minute video
          released on his Youtube Channel that treats the thefts as a crime story and not a social media trend. One of the young men in the video is quickly arrested afterwards, and
          clips from
          the video, though relatively obscure at the time, are frequently referenced in subsequent reporting.
          <br><br>
          The first viral moment for the phenomena, visible as a peak in search interest, is in July 2022, when
          Tiktok user
          ‘Robbierayyyy’ uploaded a video where he demonstrates the flaw. Though this video has since been deleted and
          lost,
          contemporary coverage describes it as an adult man demonstrating the ‘hack’ in his own car with a bewildered
          tone, and
          not a ‘Kia Boyz’ video or a social media ‘challenge’. This original video appears to have generated a sizable
          wave of
          responses on tiktok, which from there began to slip into traditional media. The first actually recorded use of
          the
          phrase ‘Kia Challenge’ appears then, in an article on FOX59, an Indiana-based local FOX news affiliate.
          From
          there the tiktok trend narrative quickly totally eclipses the prior scant coverage of the
          ‘Kia
          Boyz’, and the premise of the articles shifts from noting the waves of thefts to essentially asking the reader
          ‘is
          your son stealing Kias because of a tiktok?’. [like three quotes saying this would really hit here].
          ‘Robbierayyyy’,
          in a later video that has also been deleted, is seen watching media coverage of the ‘Kia Challenge’, which he
          laughs
          off as absurd.
          <br><br>
          The second, largest peak is in October 2022, when four young men in upstate New York were killed in an
          accident
          driving a stolen Kia. Aside from acknowledging this event, media coverage, still driven mostly by local news
          networks,
          is very similar to the first peak.
          <br><br>
          Past this point, searches for the term ‘Kia Challenge’ fall away almost completetely and are superseded by
          the
          more neutrally-phrased ‘Kia Thefts’, which is associated with broader national-level media coverage that is much less lurid and sensationalistic. The most significant events from that point
          onwards
          surround the large lawsuits being levelled against Kia: first a suit from the city of Milwaukee,
          which
          reached a $200 million dollar settlement in May 2023, and the second a class action lawsuit, combining efforts
          from
          hundreds of plaintiffs and several cities, which reached a $150 million dollar settlement in February 2024 and
          is
          visible as the third peak in search interest. Looking at the location data for these searches for the term
          ‘Kia
          Thefts’ in this period shows them as concentrated in the midwest, close to the cities of Chicago and Milwaukee
          where
          (likely) most of the thefts took place, indicating that some could be the victims of the crimes
          themselves.
          <br><br>
          The media’s fixation on the Kia challenge is best understood in the context of the broader cultural response
          to Tiktok
          and social media as a whole, and clear parralels can be seen in past coverage of much more innocuous events, like the 2021 Sea Shanty Craze. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="shantyChart"></div>
      <div class="illustrationcolumn3">
        <div class="text9">
          <p>
            As a platform, Tiktok’s design eschews the typical social media experience by
            showing
            users a feed of video content selected by an algorithm that they only directly control by choosing to watch more
            content
            that they find engaging. In this environment anything that provokes a visceral enough reaction to hold a
            user’s
            attention for long enough can be successful, positive or negative. An
            adorable cat
            video can be just as effective as a mostly-nude woman, a bizarrely unpalatable meal, or a group of teenagers
            speeding
            in a stolen car. Viral content often discursivem beginning with positive engagement from a small group, then
            widespread shock
            and derision when it reaches a wider audience.  By the time the broader media has caught up to the trend, this distinction is lost, and all the traffic is treated as sincere positive interest. 
            <br>
            <br>
Sea Shanties aptly demonstrated this tendency in mid-2021, when a cover of New
            Zealand folk
            song ‘The Wellerman’ had a sudden viral success and spawned hundreds of remixes, parodies and responses,
            before
            falling out of popularity again less than a month later. Mainstream media coverage of this trend treated it
            as both a curiosity and a potential sign of a broader cultural moment, spawning articles several articles
            where
            journalists speculated that a single 19th century whaling ballad meme allowed a lockdown-harried Generation
            Z to ‘find
            delight in a centuries-old music genre meant to bind separate bodies together into one shared, cooperative
            action.’
            Did Generation Z actually develop an interest in Sea Shanties? No. The Google trend data shows two peaks:
            one for the
            initial spread of the ‘Wellerman’ memes in early 2021, and another when several Sea Shanty festivals
            attempted to
            capitalise on this moment in mid 2022. The memes had a few weeks of popularity, and then went, but the
            temptation to
            run articles speculating about their provenance, asking ‘can you believe Generation Z now loves Sea
            Shanties?’ proved
            irresistible.
            <br><br>
            The Kia Challenge narrative is essentially this narrative, that can be applied to any Tiktok trend, coupled
            with the
            typical local news fixation on crime. Any evidence of anything like a Tiktok trend centred around automobile
            theft
            happening anywhere in the world is enough to run an article speculating about the possibility of it
            happening in your
            backyard, to the point that numerous Australian local news outlets like Channel 9 and Channel 7 have run
            articles
            about the Kia Challenge that are essentially identical to their American siblings, despite the fact that the
            presence
            of immobilisers in all Australian vehicles makes anything like it impossible. When the initial viral traffic
            on Tiktok
            fell away and it became untenable to keep speculating about teenagers stealing cars because of memes, the
            coverage of
            Kia theft turned to much more typical crime coverage. The sort that engages with the recovering victims and
            the
            structural causes.
            <br><br>
            The Kia theft phenomena is a powerful demonstration of how social media, when coupled with traditional
            media, can
            distort our perceptions of reality. Obvious corporate malfeasance creates a wave of opportunistic property
            crime, to
            the point that the criminals post content celebrating it. Then the rest of the world, seeing only the
            content,
            hallucinates a scarier version of events where the content is itself the cause. Life in the 2020s.
